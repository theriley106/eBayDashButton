# eBayDashButton

[![N|Solid](src/AmeBay.png)](#)

Utilizing Nekmo's Amazon Dash Framework, I was successfully able to modify an Amazon Dash button to purchase products from eBay...

Please note: The lines that actually pay for the product are commented out.  Feel free to modify this code in any way you see fit.  I am not responsible for any accidentally purchases made using your dash button :)
